# QuantumChat — Mobile

Native Flutter messenger for Android, built for Play Store distribution. It talks to the same QuantumChat backend as the web app and uses the same client-side X25519 / NaCl sealed-box encryption: private keys never leave the phone.

## What it includes

- Landing, register, login, 2FA, forgot password
- `keys.txt` backup after signup, and an unlock gate (import keys or generate a new pool)
- Conversation list (All / Unread / Groups / Friends) with presence
- Encrypted DMs and group chats, realtime Socket.IO, typing, read/delivery ticks
- Reactions, search, new chat, create group
- Settings: profile, privacy, theme (Dark / Light / Eyecare), API URL, logout

Calls, stories, QuantumAI, and attachments are not in this first mobile cut — text messaging, groups, and the keyring match the web client.

## Prerequisites

- Flutter 3.38+ (`flutter doctor`)
- A running QuantumChat backend (`cd ../backend && npm run dev` → `http://localhost:5000`)

## First-time platform files

If `android/` is missing or incomplete:

```bash
cd mobileApp
flutter create . --project-name quantumchat --org labs.quantumlogics --platforms android
```

That fills in Gradle scaffolding without replacing `lib/`.

## Run

```bash
cd mobileApp
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

See [docs/RUN.md](docs/RUN.md) for emulator/device specifics, API URL configuration
(`10.0.2.2` vs `localhost` vs LAN IP), and running against the production backend.

## Encryption (same as web)

1. Register generates a 5-key X25519 pool on device and publishes only the public halves.
2. Each DM is sealed twice (`forRecipient` + `forSender`) with `nacl.box`.
3. Groups seal one envelope per member.
4. Login does not create keys. If this device has no matching keyring, import `keys.txt` or generate a new pool (old ciphertext stays unreadable).
5. Logout clears the JWT session only — the keyring stays in secure storage.
