# Contributing to QuantumChat Mobile

Thanks for contributing to the QuantumChat Flutter client for Android. It talks to the
same backend as the web app and holds the same client-side X25519 / NaCl keyring: private keys
never leave the phone.

## Before you start

1. Read [`docs/REQUIREMENTS.md`](https://github.com/QuantumLogicsLabs/QuantumChat/blob/main/docs/REQUIREMENTS.md) (E2E X5 rules).
2. Follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
3. Report vulnerabilities via [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md), not public issues.
4. For Gradle toolchain setup and known build issues, see [BUILD.md](BUILD.md).

## Development setup

```bash
cd mobileApp
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

You need a running [QuantumChat-Backend](https://github.com/QuantumLogicsLabs/QuantumChat-Backend)
(`npm run dev` → `http://localhost:5000`). See the [README](../README.md) for emulator vs. device
API URLs — the Android emulator uses `10.0.2.2`, not `localhost`.

## Checks before a PR

```bash
flutter analyze
flutter test
dart format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed lib test
```

Do not introduce:

- Logging of private keys, seeds, or `keys.txt` contents (`avoid_print` is intentionally off in
  [`analysis_options.yaml`](../analysis_options.yaml), so this isn't caught automatically — review
  it by hand)
- Key material stored outside `flutter_secure_storage` (see `lib/crypto/key_storage.dart`)
- Sending message plaintext to the API or QuantumAI without an explicit client opt-in path
- Breaking the sealed-box round trip covered by `test/crypto_test.dart`

## Pull requests

1. Keep changes focused.
2. Preserve client-held keys and X5 sealed-box behavior — the server should never need plaintext.
3. Add or update a test in `test/` when touching `lib/crypto/`.
4. Note any platform-specific setup a reviewer needs (Android SDK version, etc.) in the PR description —
   there's no CI configured on this repo yet, so builds are verified locally.
